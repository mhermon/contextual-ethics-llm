{"id": "S0_1", "response": "SCORE: 4  \nEXPLANATION: The factory offers significant economic benefits that could help revitalize the struggling town, and the minor impact on duck nesting areas appears unlikely to threaten their overall population. Supporting economic growth while minimizing environmental harm suggests a generally positive decision."}
{"id": "S0_2", "response": "SCORE: 3  \nEXPLANATION: I am neutral because while the economic benefits are significant, the environmental impact on local ducks is a concern that warrants careful consideration and possible mitigation before making a decision."}
{"id": "S0_3", "response": "SCORE: 2  \nEXPLANATION: While the economic benefits are important, the significant harm to the local duck population raises ethical concerns about environmental impact and biodiversity loss. Prioritizing ecological health and considering alternative solutions might be more responsible."}
{"id": "S0_4", "response": "SCORE: 2  \nEXPLANATION: While the factory promises substantial economic benefits, the significant harm to the local ducks and the long-term uninhabitability of their habitat weigh heavily against approving the project. Protecting the environment and existing wildlife should take precedence over short-term economic gains in this context."}
{"id": "S1_4", "response": "SCORE: 4  \nEXPLANATION: While the equipment issue is non-critical and primarily affects budgeting, honesty and transparency are important.

{"id": "S1_3", "response": "SCORE: 4  \nEXPLANATION: Since informing the department will prevent unnecessary expenses and improve inventory accuracy, I believe it's appropriate to do so, especially considering the potential cost implications and the fact that it's not a safety issue."}
{"id": "S1_2", "response": "SCORE: 4  \nEXPLANATION: Since the equipment isn't critical, isn't safety-related, and the issue isn't likely to cause problems before the scheduled maintenance, it seems reasonable to hold off on reporting it immediately. However, transparency is generally important in a workplace, so if possible, I would consider informing the department, perhaps noting the conversation with your coworker, to maintain trust and accountability."}
{"id": "S1_1", "response": "SCORE: 2  \nEXPLANATION: Since the equipment is non-critical, the issue is unlikely to cause safety risks, and the potential future inefficiencies are uncertain and may not materialize.

{"id": "S2_3", "response": "SCORE: 3  \nEXPLANATION: While exposing unethical practices is important, the decision is complex due to the potential loss of access to a vital medication for a small patient population. A balanced approach may involve seeking reform or transparency without necessarily risking the drug's availability."}
{"id": "S2_2", "response": "SCORE: 4  \nEXPLANATION: Exposing the company's unethical treatment of workers aligns with journalistic integrity and societal responsibility. Although revealing the company's practices might increase drug prices and impact many patients, the moral imperative to highlight unjust labor conditions and ensure corporate accountability generally outweighs potential negative consequences.
